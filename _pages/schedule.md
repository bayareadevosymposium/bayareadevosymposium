This year's Bay Area Developmental Symposium will be held at held at Stanford University in Palo Alto, CA, on Thursday, May 9. The event will start around lunchtime (~12pm) and end after a group dinner (~7-8pm). The schedule will include a poster session, a set of brief talks, as well as lunch and dinner to meet and talk with the other attendees.


We warmly invite all SBSC-M participants to either give a <b>short talk or poster</b>, and we explicitly welcome <b>work at any stage</b>, including just an experimental idea or initial pilot results!

<h2>Talks</h2>
The finalized talk format will depend on the number of submissions but involves a presentation and Q&A portion (e.g., 15+5 or 25+5 for talks and Q&As, respectively).

Please feel free to reach out to us if you have any questions about presenting or ideas for talk formats!

<h2>Posters</h2>
We are hoping that everyone will feel comfortable presenting a poster on <b>work at any stage</b>, including just an experimental idea or initial pilot results. We highly recommend that you come present a poster if you feel that you do not have enough content for a talk! The specific format of posters will be announced and communicated at a later date; check back in April for updates.
