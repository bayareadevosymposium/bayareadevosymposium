<h2>Talks</h2>
Talks will be 15 minutes each (including Q&A). There are two talk sessions, each including presentations centered around a broader theme:

<b>Talk Session 1: Language Development and Visual Attention</b>

    <div id="session1" style="display:none;">
    In this talk, I will discuss the first known case of DeafBlind children learning conventionalized “Protactile” language and interactive practices in the tactile modality. Protactile language is a new emerging tactile language, but to our knowledge has not yet been acquired by DeafBlind children. Bringing anthropological and psychological approaches together, we ask whether joint attention towards a shared point of reference is a product of socialization and cultural learning or is a skill that develops on a maturational timetable. Because these children have resided in sighted environments with hearing, sighted parents without much perceptible access to others’ actions and language input, it is an open question whether they readily develop tactile joint attention, which sets the foundation for learning Protactile phonology and deictic references (e.g., pointing). We present a case study of two DeafBlind children (n=2; 3;3-3;5 years) and analyze their naturalistic interactions with a DeafBlind adult who is a speaker of Protactile language. Using grounded ethnographic fieldnotes and linguistic analysis, we find that upon exposure to a DeafBlind language model, these children were gradually socialized to perform, perceive, and establish contact in the tactile modality in a way that is consistent with conventional articulatory mechanisms organized by protactile phonology and interactional practices, including joint attention. Secondly, the linguistic analysis demonstrates that the adult adjusts their use of language by innovating new constructions and functions in Protactile language. Both children and adults contribute to language emergence as they adjust to one another in the unfolding of interaction. Our findings suggest that language development and emergence are shaped, in part, by socially and culturally specific patterns of perception and attention.
