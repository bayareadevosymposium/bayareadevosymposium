<h2>Faculty Roundtable</h2>

The roundtable will consist of two sessions: the first will be more research focused (12:45-1:05pm) and the second will be more professional development focused (1:10-1:30pm). Student representatives will help facilitate the sessions. The main goals of both sessions are for attendees to get to know more about faculty's work, for attendees to meet people from other schools, and for everyone to learn from one another about a mutual topic of interest.

<h2>Talks</h2>

Talks will be 15 minutes each (including Q&A). There are two talk sessions, each including presentations centered around a broader theme. For an overview of talks, see below; for a more comprehensive list including abstracts, see <a href="https://bayareadevosymposium.github.io/bayareadevosymposium/talks" target="_blank">our talk subpage here</a>!

The first session is from 1:40-2:55pm (with setup from 1:30-1:40pm) and the second session is from 4:25-5:40pm (with setup during the coffee break from 4:15-4:25pm).

<h2>Posters</h2>
We are excited to host a range of poster presentations; for an overview see our <a href="https://bayareadevosymposium.github.io/bayareadevosymposium/posters" target="_blank">poster subpage here</a>!

There will be one poster session from 3:10-4:10pm, <b>held outdoors</b> in the Philosophy Courtyard at Stanford University. We recognize that having one poster session might not allow you to easily see others’ posters; however, we will have the poster boards available starting at 12pm when you arrive, so you are welcome to hang up your poster then and look at the other posters during the coffee breaks.
 
The <b>recommended poster size is 36 (height) x 48 inches (width)</b>, and the maximum size for posters is 4 feet (height) x 8 feet (width). You do not need to use the full space. Push pins will be provided!
