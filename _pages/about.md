The 2024 installment of the <b>Bay Area Developmental Symposium</b> will take place at Stanford University on <b>Thursday, May 9</b>!

<h2>What is it?</h2>

The Bay Area Developmental Symposium is a one-day gathering to promote developmental research in the Bay Area. We are eager to make this event trainee-focused, meaning that we warmly invite graduate students, postdocs, and research staff to attend and present their work! Faculty are also welcome and highly encouraged to attend.

In past iterations, researchers have come from <b>S</b>tanford, UC <b>B</b>erkeley, UC <b>S</b>anta <b>C</b>ruz, and UC <b>M</b>erced (hence SBSC-M!). This year, we are very excited for scholars from UC Davis to join us, too!

Research areas include, but are not limited to:
<ul>
  <li>a</li>
  <li>b</li>
  <li>c</li>
</ul>
