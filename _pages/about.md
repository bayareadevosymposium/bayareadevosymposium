The Bay Area Developmental Symposium is a <b>one-day gathering to promote developmental research</b> in the Bay Area. We are devoted to making this event <b>trainee-focused</b>, meaning that we warmly invite graduate students, postdocs, and research staff to attend and present their ongoing work! Faculty are also highly encouraged to attend.

In past iterations, researchers have come from <b>S</b>tanford, UC <b>B</b>erkeley, UC <b>S</b>anta <b>C</b>ruz, and UC <b>M</b>erced (hence SBSC-M!). This year, we are very excited for scholars from UC Davis to join us, too!
