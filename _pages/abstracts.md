We expect to release our finalized program by mid-April! This year's Bay Area Developmental Symposium will start around lunchtime (~12pm) and end after a group dinner (~7-8pm). The schedule will include a poster session, a set of brief talks, as well as lunch and dinner to meet and talk with the other attendees!

We warmly invite all SBSC-M participants to either give a <b>short talk or poster</b>, and we explicitly welcome <b>work at any stage</b>, including just an experimental idea or initial pilot results!

<h2>Talks</h2>
For those <b>interested in giving a talk</b>, please submit an <b>abstract</b> of no longer than XXX words using the <b>link below</b>. These abstracts will help us structure and constrain our talk schedule (in accordance with the number of submissions) and help us gain a sense of potential theme blocks.

The talk format is not yet finalized but will involve a presentation and Q&A portion (e.g., 15+5 or 25+5 for talks and Q&As, respectively).

Please feel free to reach out to us if you have any questions about presenting or ideas for talk formats!

<b>Submission Form Link<b>: <a href="" target="_blank">Google Form</a>

<b>DEADLINE:</b> The above submission form will close on <u></b>April 3, 2024, 12 PM PT</b></u>.

<h2>Posters</h2>
We are hoping that everyone will feel comfortable presenting a poster on work at any stage, including just an experimental idea or initial pilot results. We highly recommend that you sign up for a poster if you don't feel like you have enough content for a talk!

The specific format of posters will be announced and communicated at a later date.
