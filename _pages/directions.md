<h2>Parking Information</h2>
For those who have provided their license plate numbers to their student representatives, your vehicle is registered electronically. You do not need a physical pass. Please park in areas designated for A-permit or C-permit holders (signs for A and C parking will be visible). 

<h2>Venue Directions</h2>
Upon arriving at the front of Building 420, proceed straight down the main hallway, make a right at the end, and this path will lead you directly to the back of Building 420. Here, you will find the poster sessions and the area where lunch will be served, which is held outdoors. The talk sessions will be held in Rm 041 of Building 420. This is on the lower level of the building (button LL on the elevator).
